1. can you introduce yourself
Hi I am Yanbai Zhang from China, I am an Frontend engineer.
in university, my major is infomation and computing science
After graduated I was workign at a travel internet startups in china, mainly focus on mobile web application developing

Then I move to current company, this is a outsourcing company, mainly focus on client from europ
At begining in this company, I was responsible for a CMS developing, including an online style editor and then some other e-commerce project such as ink-online,
which is an angular js project, also a e-commerce platform sell ink and printer.

In the past two years Ive been serving for Gobear which is a singaporean economic platform,
gobear is a vue web application project with mobile and desktop version, deployed in 7 countries,
every country has 6 or 7 similar product, such as personal loan, different kinds of insurances

gobear is one of our client, my company's contract with gobear ends up at the end of last september,after gobear, I am responsible for a multiple platform project, which is an online education project， a chat system, 埋点
using uni-app

company also ask me to do research for an electron project, gm
electron project target is to automatically login a Tax website, help the enterprise to declare tax， include two parts:
one part is login, we need to recognize the verification code
another part is to fill in the form and then give a screen shot

how to recognize the verification code
Binarization
dirty point cleaning
Template library matching

electron: BrowserWindow
gm: threshold, colors


also I learn react and react native by my-self

<!-- My role is a lead engineer of a frontend team
in gobear, we have developer team based in singapore, vietnam and china. In china we around 30 developers
all the developers from different country were divided into more than ten small team, each team has 4-5 people, each team has their own focus -->

<!-- , but I consider myself as a normal developer
My mainly responsiblity is coding, -->
gobear is a vue web application project with mobile and desktop version, deployed in 7 countries,
every country has 6 or 7 similar product, such as personal loan, different kinds of insurances
my team focus on 3 parts: 1. building a Vue component library 2. help maintain the current gobear website
3.to implement a new online service which would privide personal identity verification

我叫张岩柏 目前在中国，担任前端开发已经差不多9年了。

刚毕业不久 我作为一个前端开发 为一个线上旅游平台工作

在现有的公司 我已经工作了将近五年了，这是一家外包公司
我起初负责一个CMS系统开发，然后参与了一些其他电商平台的开发，比如ink online，一个卖油墨打印机的线上平台
在过去的两年多的时间里，我为gobear 服务
gobear有中国和越南团队，大概有十几个小组 我们叫他scrum team，我在gobear的role是一个小组的LE，但是我自己认为我是一个senior developer
帮助gobear建立web端网上比价平台，以及vue 组件库的开发


2.1 更详细说下你的工作成就\
# vue 组件库
## nut shell
	• this is a CSS library + Vue UI component library，it is a npm package
  why we don't use current UI component, (we are inspired from element UI alot) since we develop UI library after the web application is stable, so if we develop based on current third-party library, there would be alot of problem when we do integrate
  and also we have some special user interact
## deploy plan
deployment plan, use CICD to automatically deploy, use CICD to do PR checking when create PR to check code coverage, 80%
Jest + TC + sonar cloud

## SSR ready
tech Solution
do research for one or two component, figure out some problem when implement SSR ready, like
1. how to check server env or client in component(compile or runtime?)
const isServer = Vue.prototype.$isServer
this.$isServer
2. use feature check
bodyEl: typeof document === 'undefined' || document.body
3. use life cycle
If (typeof window !== 'undefined')
mounted
created

setup an ssr env for
## Theamify
Solution
  sass themify mixin, themed function
  a. define global theme ns like: $theme-button: (dark: ())
  b. use @include themify($theme-button) { padding: themed('xxxx') }
  总结：themify生成 .dp-theme-dark { selector { padding: 'xxxx' }}
## better solution ? use context, create a ThemeProvider component, return <ThemeContext.Provider value={style}>{props.children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
### how to use
```js
<Provider theme={{theme: "dark", defaultFontSize: 18}}>
  <Text />
  <List />
</Provider>

<Consumer>
  {
    (themeStyle) => {
      return (
        <Text style={{fontSize: themeStyle.defaultFontSize}}>
          Text 组件
        </Text>
      )
    }
  }
</Consumer>
```
### priority: style > custom theme color > default theme color
```js
<Provider theme={{ defaultFontSize: "#666" }}><Provider>
<Provider style={{ backgroundColor: "#666" }}><Provider>
```
### generate style config in provider, get style config in consumer

```js
const ThemeProvider = (props) => {
  let style = getStyle(props.value)
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value={style}>{props.children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}

class ThemeConsumer extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Consumer>
        {
          style => {
            return this.props.children(style)
          }
        }
      </ThemeContext.Consumer>
    )
  }
}
```
### theme default usage
```js
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light')
class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
                <Toolbar />
            </ThemeContext.Provider>
        )
    }
}
// 不用通过中间组件传递prop
function Toolbar() {
    return (
        <div>
            <ThemedButton />
        </div>
    )
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
    static contextType = ThemeContext
    render() {
        return <Button theme={this.contxt} />
    }
}

```

## Partly import
  Diffuculties
    register component globally performance issue
    register in two data structure:
	 a. {key: 'route-string'} for multiple entry
	 b. {key: require('route-string')} for global install
    import js and css is ugly, we need one line to import both

        if we want component_a, only require(‘xxx/xxx/component_a.js’). It is ugly
        What if we do like ‘import { a } from componentLibrary’, can we only import code about ‘a’? Answer is No, it will still import the whole component code. Because ‘componentLibrary’ still must have included all the code so that user can import whatever they want.

Solution for partly import
  create two data structure for multiple entry and global install
   a. {key: 'route-string'} for output
   b. {key: require('../src/components/' + components[key])} for global install
 use babel-plugin-component, to transfer
‘import { a, b, c } from componentLibrary’ to ‘a = require(“xx/xx/a”); b = require(“xx/xx/b”); c = require(“xx/xx/c”)’


# ssr
## ssr theory
vue-server-renderer, render the same components into HTML strings on the server, send them directly to the browser, and finally "hydrate" the static markup into a fully interactive app on the client

Better SEO, as the search engine crawlers will directly see the fully rendered page.
Server-rendered markup doesn't need to wait until all JavaScript has been downloaded and executed to be displayed, so your user will see a fully-rendered page sooner.

# vue application
fallback system:
for example, from component level, we have country level folder and common folder, when we import a specific component, we will find in country level folder at first, then common folder, this rule also happens in style and services, store


2.2. 之前遇到过什么问题
themify improvement ?
runtime env ?


2.3 after gobear and in free time
after gobear, I am responsible for a wechat programme using uni-app, a chat system, 埋点

company also ask me to do research for an electron project, gm
how to recognize the verification code

also I learn react and react native by my-self

3. some tech stack

## uni-app
two kind of render engin: webview(web) and weex(native)
webview(in Andoid SDK): It uses the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages embeded in app
在Android手机中内置了一款高性能webkit内核浏览器，在SDK中封装为一个叫做WebView组件

nvue use weex

## weex
A framework for building Mobile cross-platform UI.
client use js Core/v8 to compile JS,
<!-- has a weex-framework to compile vue into DOM  -->
then use weex bridge to communicate with native render engin (callJS  callNative, can do two way communicate)
so it is not browser render, it is native render
Weex 渲染引擎与 DSL 语法层是分开的，Weex 并不强依赖任何特定的前端框架。


## electron will carry own v8 engin in package ?


## rn compile to native ios or android language ? fb
IOS: JSCore can run js
Android: jsc.so

## code split?
optimization.splitChunks

4. how to study
从知识架构上分, css（一二代布局，难点概念，原生使用，框架研究） js（难点概念，原生使用，框架研究）
从tech stack上分, vue react rn uniapp electron webpack

根绝重点看，比如某个技术站点里面搜所有组件开发的文章

开发先处理核心功能，比如做主题化，我会先不处理 强制模式 暴露样式表
学习也一样 先学main flow，这样代码比较少

平常会根据这个体系来看，并且在实际项目中应用
